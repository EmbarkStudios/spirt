**SPIR-ðŸ‡¹** is a research project aimed at exploring shader-oriented IR designs derived from SPIR-V, and producing a framework around such an IR to facilitate advanced compilation pipelines, beyond what existing SPIR-V tooling allows for.

Such a need arose in the [Rust-GPU](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu) project, which requires a variety of legalization passes to turn general-purpose (Rust<sup>1</sup>) code operating on *untyped* memory, into GPU-friendly direct data-flow.
Our goal is to replace the existing [Rust-GPU](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu) SPIR-V legalizations passes with **SPIR-ðŸ‡¹** equivalents - but even more imporantly, **SPIR-ðŸ‡¹** should allow writing much more powerful legalization/optimization passes, that would've been unfathomable<sup>2</sup> for direct SPIR-V manipulation.

---

<sub><sup>1</sup> Rust is not unique in its needs here, and more languages (or IRs) could eventually make use of such a framework, but the initial design and implementation work has focused on [Rust-GPU](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu)</sub>

<sub><sup>2</sup> not outright impossible, but requiring excessive development/maintenance cost, having to constantly balance correctness and power (more conservative passes are easier to trust), etc.</sub>

## Status

ðŸš§ *This project is in active design and development, many details can and will change* ðŸš§

### Non-goals (at least in the short term)

* supporting the ("OpenCL") `Kernel` dialect of SPIR-V
  * `Kernel` SPIR-V is much closer to LLVM IR, than `Shader` SPIR-V, and
    as such tooling oriented around LLVM is more likely to be a better fit
* textual syntax that can be parsed back
  * i.e. the pretty-printer output is purely a visualization

### Designed and implemented so far

<table>
<tr><td width="50%">

**IR datatypes**:
* allowing near-arbitrary SPIR-V instructions for any unrecognized opcodes
  * IDs are replaced with interned/"entity" handles (see below)
* interning for attributes (decorations & similar), types and constants
  * i.e. automatic deduplication, efficient indexing, and no concept of "definition"
    (only uses of interned handles can lead to a module being considered to contain a specific type/constant)
* "entity" system for e.g. definitions in a module, instructions in a function, etc.
  * disallows iteration in favor of/forcing the use of efficient indexing
* structured control-flow "regions" inspired by RVSDG, stricter than SPIR-V
  (see `ControlRegionDef`'s docs for more details)

</td><td>

**Framework utilities**:
* `visit`/`transform`: immutable/mutable IR traversal
* `print`: pretty-printer with (syntax-highlighted and hyperlinked) HTML output

**Passes (to/from/on SPIR-ðŸ‡¹)**:
* `spv::lower`: "lowering" from SPIR-V, normalizing away many irrelevant details
  * lossy for some relevant details (these are bugs, though many are non-semantic so lower priority)
* `spv::lift`: "lifting" back up to SPIR-V, making arbitrary choices where necessary
  * comparable to e.g. generating GLSL syntax from SPIR-V, just one level down
* `cfg::Structurizer`: (re)structurization, from arbitrary control-flow to the stricter structured "regions"
* `passes::link`: mapping (linkage) imports to relevant exports

## GPU (shader) IR landscape overview
*(and the vision of how **SPIR-ðŸ‡¹** fits into it)*

![](docs/landscape.svg)

The distinction being made here is between:
* **Interchange IRs** (standards that many tools can use to interoperate)
  * SPIR-V was very much intended as such a standard
    (outside of the GPU space, wasm is also a great example)
  * they only need to encode the right concepts, not straying too far away from what tools understand, but the design effort is often oriented around being a "serialization" format
* **Compiler IRs** (non-standard implementation details of compilers)
  * LLVM is quite well-known, but Mesa's NIR is even closer to **SPIR-ðŸ‡¹**
    (both being shader-oriented, and having similar specialized choices of e.g. handling control-flow)
  * these _have to_ handle legalization/optimization passes quite well, and in general a lot of on-the-fly transformations - as their main purpose is to _expedite_ such operations
  * this is where **SPIR-ðŸ‡¹** sits, as a kind of "relative"/dialect of SPIR-V, but making trade-offs in favor of the "intra-compiler" usage
